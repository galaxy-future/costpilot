Introduction
-----
CostPilot is an all-in-one cloud cost management platform that applies to applications hosted on all cloud platforms. Developed by Galaxy-Future based on the FinOps discipline, CostPilot helps enterprises cut cloud spending by up to 50%. This platform provides deep insights into your cloud cost, periodic reports that contain both cloud cost data and custom cost optimization suggestions from multiple perspectives, and even state-of-the-art techniques that you can use to efficiently optimize cloud usage.

Getting Started Guide
----
#### 1. Configuration Requirements

- To ensure stable operation of the system, we recommend that you use a server with at least 2 CPU cores and 4 GB RAM. For Linux and MacOS systems, CostPilot has already been tested.
- The AK/SK used in operation needs to have the permission to read the bill (charge) of the corresponding cloud account.

#### 2. Run in Source Code
To run CostPilot in source code, you need to install Git ( [Git - Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)) and Go (**version 1.17+ is required**) and set your Go workspace first.

* (1) Download source code
  > git clone https://github.com/galaxy-future/costpilot.git
* (2) Use environment variables. You can analyze only one cloud account at a time if you use this method.
  - Replace 'abc' with your own AK/SK.
  ```shell
       COSTPILOT_PROVIDER=AlibabaCloud COSTPILOT_AK=abc COSTPILOT_SK=abc COSTPILOT_REGION_ID=cn-beijing go run .
  ```
* (3) Use a configuration file. You can analyze multiple cloud accounts at a time if you use this method.
    -  Edit conf/config.yaml as follows. You can add multiple items in cloud_accounts. Only AlibabaCloud is supported as provider for now.
     ```yaml
        cloud_accounts:
          - provider:  # required :AlibabaCloud
            ak:  # required
            sk:  # required
            region_id:  # required
            name:  # not required
    ```
    - Execute the following make command:
        ```shell
        make build && make run
      ```
    - After the analysis is complete, visit website/index.html in a browser to view the analysis result.

#### 3. Run in Docker
To run CostPilot in Docker, you need to install Docker first. For more information, see
[Docker Engine Install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

* (1) Use environment variables. You can analyze only one cloud account at a time if you use this method.
  - Replace 'abc' with your own AK/SK.
    ```shell
    docker run --env COSTPILOT_PROVIDER=AlibabaCloud --env COSTPILOT_AK=abc --env COSTPILOT_SK=abc --env COSTPILOT_REGION_ID=cn-beijing -p 8504:8504 --name=costpilot galaxy-future/costpilot
    ```
* (2) Use a configuration file. You can analyze multiple cloud accounts at a time if you use this method.
  - Create your own config.yaml file, and then execute the following command. Replace /tmp/config.yaml with the absolute path of your config.yaml file.
    ```shell
    docker run --mount type=bind,source=/tmp/config.yaml,target=/home/tiger/app/conf/config.yaml -p 8504:8504 --name=costpilot galaxy-future/costpilot
    ```
